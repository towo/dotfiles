# towo's dotfiles

Because there aren't enough dotfiles repositories out there, you know.

This repository is focused around using `vcsh`, with technically optional usage
of `mr`.

I'm trying to go for a mostly XDG-compatible approach; this should technically
allow you to just port over XDG_CONFIG_HOME when sudoing, as one of the
advantages
